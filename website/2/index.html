	<h1 id="header">What a Phobia IS and how they affect us</h1>
	
	<hr id="separator">
	<p>Welcome to the website! I created this website as a learning aid to teach inexperienced people about Phobia Psychology. After reading through this website you should understand the hardships that people who suffer from a phobia go to, and those who do suffer will learn about the path to recovery and mental help.</p>
	<p>Before we look at Phobia Psychology in greater detail, lets define what a phobia actually is. A Phobia is an irrational fear of something. You can have a phobia towards anything, be it an object, animal, place or even scenario. For someone suffering from a phobia the danger presented by the Phobic Stimulus is perceived as being far greater than it actually is; for example: someone with Arachnophobia may be terrified by even the smallest, weakest species of spider even when there is no danger of said spider inflicting any damage to the victim. </p>
	<p>A phobia is a type of ‘Anxiety Disorder’ (Like PTSD or Panic Disorder), meaning that people suffering from a phobia have no control over the anxiety caused by it, but they often do not experience any symptoms until the phobia stimulus is physically present. </p>
	<p>A phobia triggers the sufferer’s Fight or Flight reaction, meaning that victims might experience: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Nausea</li>
		<li>Sweating</li>
		<li>Light-Headedness</li>
		<li>Increased Heart rate</li>
	</ul>
	<p>And other similar bodily reactions</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Specific Phobias</h1>
	<p>Specific Phobias refer to a fear that is centred around a distinct stimulus. Many phobias fall into this category and it is often the type that people think of when they hear the word ‘phobia’, but this is not the only category. </p>
	<p>Common Specific Phobias: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Arachnophobia – Fear of Spiders</li>
		<li>Acrophobia – Fear of Heights</li>
		<li>Claustrophobia – Fear of Tight Spaces</li>
		<li>Hemophobia – Fear of Blood</li>
		<li>Performance Anxiety</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<h2>Complex Phobias</h1>
	<p>Complex Phobias are more intricate than specific phobias and tend to be more severe. Phobias that fall into this category are often oversimplified to a point that is not entirely accurate. These fears usually develop later in life and are typically associated with a situation. </p>
	<p>Agoraphobia and Social Phobia are both examples of Complex Phobias that often get reduced to just simply being defined as “fear of open spaces” or “fear of talking to people”, but the anxiety associated with these disorders run far deeper than those definitions. This program does not have any situations for Complex Phobias, and you are strongly recommended to seek a real therapist if you feel like you might suffer from one.</p>

	<br>

	<h1>How Phobias Happen</h1>
	<p>Phobias are thought to occur when someone has a negative association with a stimulus, commonly obtained through Classical Conditioning, the phenomenon observed in the infamous Pavlov’s Dog study. This association might the result of a past trauma or as a learned reaction from a close family member or friend. A psychological theory called “Operant Conditioning” is often used to explain why phobias continue to affect us for long after the initial reason for it developing. Operant Conditioning states that we avoid the stimulus because of our fear, and as a result our anxiety fades and makes us feel safer. Because we prefer this feeling of safety over being scared, we are more likely to repeat those previous actions, meaning that we continually respond by avoiding the stimulus and thus reinforce our irrational fear.</p>
	<p>Specific phobias often occur in childhood and usually lessen in severity over time. These are especially likely to be learned from viewing how our close relatives react, as we internally believe that to be the appropriate response from the figures we look up to.</p>
	<p>Complex phobias usually occur in adulthood, as a deep-rooted fear of a situation that we have experienced. Many times, people may not be aware of the extent that their complex phobia affects them, believing it to be a normal thing that most people go through. There is also some evidence that suggests our genetics may make us more susceptible to developing phobias.</p>

	<h1>How Phobia Therapy works</h1>
	<p>Since Phobias work due to negative reinforcement of a continual cycle, we can use therapy to consciously highlight this loop and work on stopping it. There are various methods that can be used to treat phobias, but medication cannot be used to remove a phobia. Occasionally, medication might be approved to help people deal with the anxiety caused by an extremely difficult disorder.</p>
	<p>Gradual Exposure therapy is the most basic method of treating a specific phobia. In this method the phobic individual progressively works their way through situations that trigger a phobic response. They would start off with a small phobic trigger (such as looking at an image of their stimuli) and then eventually work up to more stressful situations, such as being in physical contact with a stimulus. By gradually exposing themselves to their phobia they start to feel less fear from it and eventually the fight or flight response to the stimulus should disappear altogether.</p>
	<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy is a talking therapy that is typically done in a 1-to-1 patient to therapist scenario whereby the therapist challenges the patient’s overreacting thoughts and gets them to change the way they think about their phobic stimuli. CBT is often used in conjunction with Gradual exposure when it comes to patients with a severe phobia, but CBT is best used when it comes to helping those suffering from a Complex Phobia. </p>
	<p>Flooding is an extreme technique typically not used by therapists. Flooding is the opposite of Gradual Exposure, as instead of the patient progressively building up resistance to the stimuli, they are thrown into a highly intense situation and can only use relaxation techniques to cope. Because phobias use that long term cycle of avoidance to reinforce the fear, when a patient experiences a continuous exposure that they are unable to run away from eventually their anxiety levels will diminish and they realize how irrational their phobia is. Flooding is considered to be a good cost-effective treatment as it is typically done only for a couple of sessions and is usually highly effective at treating certain Specific Phobias, but do be aware that the situation can be very traumatic and should be talked over with a therapist before undergoing it.</p>
