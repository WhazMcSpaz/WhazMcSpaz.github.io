	<h1 id="header">What a Phobia IS and how they affect us</h1>
	
	<hr id="separator">
	<p>Welcome to the website! I created this website as a learning aid to teach inexperienced people about Phobia Psychology. After reading through this website you should understand the hardships that people who suffer from a phobia go to, and those who do suffer will learn about the path to recovery and mental help.</p>
	<p>Before we look at Phobia Psychology in greater detail, lets define what a phobia actually is. A Phobia is an irrational fear of something. You can have a phobia towards anything, be it an object, animal, place or even scenario. For someone suffering from a phobia the danger presented by the Phobic Stimulus is perceived as being far greater than it actually is; for example: someone with Arachnophobia may be terrified by even the smallest, weakest species of spider even when there is no danger of said spider inflicting any damage to the victim. </p>
	<p>A phobia is a type of ‘Anxiety Disorder’ (Like PTSD or Panic Disorder), meaning that people suffering from a phobia have no control over the anxiety caused by it, but they often do not experience any symptoms until the phobia stimulus is physically present. </p>
	<p>A phobia triggers the sufferer’s Fight or Flight reaction, meaning that victims might experience: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Nausea</li>
		<li>Sweating</li>
		<li>Light-Headedness</li>
		<li>Increased Heart rate</li>
	</ul>
	<p>And other similar bodily reactions</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Specific Phobias</h1>
	<p>Specific Phobias refer to a fear that is centred around a distinct stimulus. Many phobias fall into this category and it is often the type that people think of when they hear the word ‘phobia’, but this is not the only category. </p>
	<p>Common Specific Phobias: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Arachnophobia – Fear of Spiders</li>
		<li>Acrophobia – Fear of Heights</li>
		<li>Claustrophobia – Fear of Tight Spaces</li>
		<li>Hemophobia – Fear of Blood</li>
		<li>Performance Anxiety</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<h2>Complex Phobias</h1>
	<p>Complex Phobias are more intricate than specific phobias and tend to be more severe. Phobias that fall into this category are often oversimplified to a point that is not entirely accurate. These fears usually develop later in life and are typically associated with a situation. </p>
	<p>Agoraphobia and Social Phobia are both examples of Complex Phobias that often get reduced to just simply being defined as “fear of open spaces” or “fear of talking to people”, but the anxiety associated with these disorders run far deeper than those definitions. This program does not have any situations for Complex Phobias, and you are strongly recommended to seek a real therapist if you feel like you might suffer from one.</p>
